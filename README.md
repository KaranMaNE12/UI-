#SMART HEALTH CONSULTANCY MANEGEMENT SYSTEM

This project mainly focuses on the development of a system, or we could say an immediate medical provision that would incorporate the symptoms and other medical data collected from thepatient and store them into a Smart health dataset. This dataset would then be analysed using the Na√Øve Bayesian machine learning algorithm to deliver results with maximum accuracy. GPS tracking will be used to suggest nearest doctor or specialist if the patient needs referral.
